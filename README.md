# Indian-Sign-Language-Recognition

The Indian Sign Language Recognition project aims to develop a real-time system using convolutional neural networks to recognize Indian Sign Language through video input. The CNN model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras and employs advanced techniques such as ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation and normalization, the Adam optimizer, and categorical cross-entropy loss to ensure accuracy for image classification tasks.

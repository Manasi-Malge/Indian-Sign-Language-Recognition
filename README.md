# Indian-Sign-Language-Recognition

Sign language is one of the oldest and most natural forms of language for communication. Still, since most people do not know sign language and interpreters are very difficult to come by, we have developed a real-time method using neural networks for fingerspelling-based Indian Sign Language. 
We collected a dataset of depth-based segmented RGB images for classifying 36 different gestures (alphabets and numerals). The system takes hand gestures as input and returns the corresponding recognised character as output in real time on the monitor screen. For classification, we used a Convolutional Neural Network.
